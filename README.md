# Practicals fo LP II (IS) & AI

This repository contains solutions to practical tasks based on various algorithms and cryptography techniques. The exercises span topics such as graph algorithms, artificial intelligence, encryption, and key exchange mechanisms.

## Table of Contents

1. **Depth First Search (DFS) & Breadth First Search (BFS)**
   - Implement the DFS and BFS algorithms using an undirected graph. Develop a recursive algorithm to search all vertices in a graph or tree structure.

2. **A* Algorithm**
   - Implement the A* algorithm to solve a game search problem.

3. **Greedy Search Algorithm**
   - Implement a Greedy algorithm for one of the following applications:
     - Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph
     - Minimal Spanning Tree (MST)

4. **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (Backtracking)**
   - Solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking.

5. **Chatbot Development**
   - Develop an elementary chatbot for customer interaction.

6. **Bitwise Operations on String**
   - Implement a program that manipulates a string "Hello World" by performing AND or XOR operations on each character with 127, displaying the results.

7. **Transposition Cipher**
   - Implement a program for encryption and decryption using the Transposition Cipher technique.

8. **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**
   - Implement the DES algorithm in any of Java/C/C++/Python.

   OR

   - Calculate the message digest of a text using the MD5 algorithm in Java.

9. **RSA Algorithm**
   - Implement the RSA encryption algorithm.

10. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**
    - Implement the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange mechanism using HTML and JavaScript with Alice as the end user and a JavaScript application representing Bob.
